# Bacteria-dataset-generator

The field of microbiology represents a challenge when designing systems that require a large amount of data. This is mainly due to the fact that access to data is conditioned on having the necessary tools, such as microscopes, cameras, bacterial cultures, among others. In addition, it requires basic knowledge of bacteriology. In the present work, a solution is proposed to obtain a set of synthetic images, where a video game engine will be used to generate images through a simulation that represents a colony of bacteria. In turn, there will be annotations automatically of the position of each bacterium in the simulation framed by a 2D rectangle. Finally, the quality and compatibility of the data with the object detection technique known as YOLO will be reviewed.
